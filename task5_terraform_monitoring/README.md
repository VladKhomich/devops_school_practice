# Notes

## Task

For this task you need use only docker.
Implement logging (loki+ grafanf) and monitoring ( Prometheus+Grafana) for the backend application (https://gitlab.com/gcorpcity122/backend-application).
For the docker container you need to install a logging driver.
Add Loki logging to the Docker Compose service.
In Grafana, you need to connect Loki and Prometheus and set up the dashboards.


## üß© Solution

The task is solved based on Microsoft Azure. The applied solution is an extension of [task3_java_postgresql](../task3_java_postgresql). There are two main differences:
- Grafana and Prometheus are set up
- Kubernetes Cluster and other resources are created not via Azure CLI but with terraform.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-based Solution

Two steps are required:
- `sh solution.terraform.sh`
- `sh solution.azure.sh`

####  ‚ö†Ô∏è To clean up resources

```
cd tf
tf destroy
```

In the scope of this stage:
- Terraform deployment is initialized
- Terraform execution plan is created
- Execution plan is applied to cloud infrastructure
  - Resource Group, Kubernetes Cluster, Node Pool, Azure Container Registry are created
  - `ImagePull` role is applied to Node Pool in order to make it possible to use images from Container Registry

This stage is a spitting image of [task3 azure stage](../task3_java_postgresql/README.md#-description-1) with some 
extensions:

- prometheus deployment is added with a dedicated service
- loki deployment is added with a dedicated service
- grafana deployment is added with a dedicated service with a public load balancer
- promtail deployment is added with a dedicated service
